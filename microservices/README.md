# Microservices Architecture Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan to transform the current monolithic finance dashboard into a microservices architecture.

## Current Architecture
- **Frontend**: React application serving the dashboard UI
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express monolithic API handling all business logic
- **Database**: MongoDB for data persistence
- **External Services**: Currency conversion API, Azure OpenAI

## Proposed Microservices

### 1. User Service
**Responsibility**: User authentication, authorization, and profile management
- **Endpoints**: 
  - POST /auth/login
  - POST /auth/register
  - GET /auth/profile
  - PUT /auth/profile
- **Database**: Users collection
- **Dependencies**: None (core service)

### 2. Transaction Service
**Responsibility**: Transaction CRUD operations and management
- **Endpoints**:
  - GET /transactions
  - POST /transactions
  - PUT /transactions/:id
  - DELETE /transactions/:id
- **Database**: Transactions collection
- **Dependencies**: User Service (for user validation)

### 3. Budget Service
**Responsibility**: Budget management and tracking
- **Endpoints**:
  - GET /budgets
  - POST /budgets
  - PUT /budgets/:id
  - DELETE /budgets/:id
- **Database**: Budgets collection
- **Dependencies**: User Service, Transaction Service

### 4. Category Service
**Responsibility**: Category management for transactions and budgets
- **Endpoints**:
  - GET /categories
  - POST /categories
  - PUT /categories/:id
  - DELETE /categories/:id
- **Database**: Categories collection
- **Dependencies**: User Service

### 5. Currency Service
**Responsibility**: Currency conversion and exchange rate management
- **Endpoints**:
  - GET /currency/rates
  - GET /currency/convert
  - GET /currency/supported
- **External APIs**: exchangerate-api.com
- **Dependencies**: None (utility service)

### 6. AI Insights Service
**Responsibility**: AI-powered financial insights and recommendations
- **Endpoints**:
  - GET /ai/insights
  - POST /ai/analyze
- **External APIs**: Azure OpenAI
- **Dependencies**: Transaction Service, Budget Service

### 7. Reports Service
**Responsibility**: Financial reports and analytics
- **Endpoints**:
  - GET /reports/dashboard
  - GET /reports/expense-summary
  - GET /reports/budget-analysis
- **Dependencies**: Transaction Service, Budget Service, Category Service

## API Gateway
**Purpose**: Single entry point for all client requests
- **Features**:
  - Request routing
  - Authentication middleware
  - Rate limiting
  - Load balancing
  - Request/response logging

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Service Extraction
1. Create individual service directories
2. Extract business logic from monolith
3. Create Docker containers for each service
4. Set up service-to-service communication

### Phase 2: Database Decomposition
1. Split MongoDB collections by service boundaries
2. Implement data consistency patterns
3. Handle distributed transactions where needed

### Phase 3: API Gateway Integration
1. Implement API gateway (Kong, Express Gateway, or custom)
2. Route requests to appropriate services
3. Implement cross-cutting concerns

### Phase 4: DevOps & Monitoring
1. Container orchestration (Docker Compose â†’ Kubernetes)
2. Service discovery
3. Health checks and monitoring
4. Centralized logging

## Technology Stack

### Service Communication
- **HTTP/REST**: For synchronous communication
- **Message Queue**: Redis/RabbitMQ for asynchronous operations
- **Service Discovery**: Docker Compose networks initially, Consul later

### Containerization
- **Docker**: Each service in its own container
- **Docker Compose**: Local development orchestration
- **Kubernetes**: Production orchestration (future)

### Monitoring & Logging
- **Health Checks**: Express health check endpoints
- **Logging**: Centralized logging with ELK stack
- **Metrics**: Prometheus + Grafana

## Benefits
1. **Scalability**: Scale services independently based on demand
2. **Technology Diversity**: Choose optimal technology for each service
3. **Team Independence**: Teams can work on services independently
4. **Fault Isolation**: Failure in one service doesn't bring down the entire system
5. **Deployment Flexibility**: Deploy services independently

## Challenges & Considerations
1. **Complexity**: Increased operational complexity
2. **Data Consistency**: Managing distributed data
3. **Network Latency**: Service-to-service communication overhead
4. **Testing**: Integration testing across services
5. **Monitoring**: Observability across distributed system

## Next Steps
1. Create individual service scaffolds
2. Extract user authentication service first
3. Implement API gateway
4. Gradually extract other services
5. Implement service discovery and monitoring
